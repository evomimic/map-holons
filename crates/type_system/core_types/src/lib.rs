//! Core Types for the Memetic Activation Platform (MAP)
//!
//! This crate defines core semantic and structural types that form the foundation
//! of the MAP Type System. These types are concerned with the **schema-level
//! representation** of MAP data â€” including names, identifiers, and structural
//! classifications.
//!
//! Key type categories include:
//! - **Semantic Names**: such as `PropertyName`, `RelationshipName`, and `SchemaName`
//! - **Identifiers**: such as `LocalId`, `ExternalId`, and `HolonId`
//! - **Structural Types**: like `PropertyMap`, `RelationshipMap`
//! - **Type Classifiers**: such as `ValueType` and `TypeKind` (formerly `TypeKind`)
//!
//! These types define the shape and meaning of data in MAP holons and descriptors,
//! and are shared across guest and client implementations.
